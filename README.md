## Instructions for Digital Stewards Assignment:

### Step 0. These instructions assume that you have already correctly set up git on your local machine and you have set up your SSH keys (so that you can connect to your GitHUB repo via SSH).

** DO NOT PROCEED UNLESS YOU HAVE DONE STEP 0**
** IF YOU NEED HELP SETTING UP, CHECK LECTURE SLIDES, ASK AN INSTRUCTOR, OR GO TO OFFICE HOURS**

### Step 1. Fork this repo by clicking the fork button on the top right of this screen.

Make sure to rename the repo to be YOUR\_GITHUB\_USERNAME.github.io

### Step 2. Clone your copy of the repo into the directory of your choice on your local machine.

To do this, first copy the address for the repo by going to the GitHub repo and clicking the green "Code" button, clicking the SSH option, and then copying the address. The address should look something like git@github.com:YOUR\_GITHUB\_USERNAME/\YOUR\_GITHUB\_USERNAME.github.io.git

Then on your local machine, on your terminal, cd into the directory that you want this repo to be located on. After that, run this command:

	$ git clone git@github.com:YOUR\_GITHUB\_USERNAME/\YOUR\_GITHUB\_USERNAME.github.io.git
